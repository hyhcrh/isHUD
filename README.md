# isHUD - An OSX Head-up Display for input sources

## Why
As a multilanguage Mac OS X user, I use the default shortcut keys (Command+Space, Option+Command+Space) to switch between input sources. But when I press Option+Command+Space (Select the next input source), the system wild input source overlay doesn't appear. With the Lion's new cool stuff, fullscreen mode, it's inconvenient for me to check the current input source.

With isHUD, everytime you change the input source, a HUD will appear right in the middle of the screen, which means there's no more need to move your eye to check the input source.

## How to use
- Just drag/move the isHUD.app into the Applications directory, open it as other app.
- [New to v0.7] Double click the Fn key to show the HUD with the current selected input source.

But you still have to use this feature together with the default system level hot key, which is Option+Command+Space.
